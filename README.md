# flexigridcss
A css framework which incorporates Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Flex box being the fallback for CSS grids and working in tandem within elements. Every developer likes the bootstrap or foundation but if your like me you only really use it for its grid system... So I made my own scalable to any amount of columns.

Written in SASS.
